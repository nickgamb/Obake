## 1. Build the application

Obake can be configured to run in many ways. However, the first step is to compile it. You will first need to install Visual Studio. 

**Notes:**

* 2019 Community was used to create the application so it is the most recomended version. 
* Obake is cross platform so Visual Studio for Windows or Mac is supported. 
* Obake can be published driectly from Visual Studio to file (for use with Linux), to AWS, to Azure, or directly to a Windows Server. 
* Obake can be ran locally (see running locally) from Visual Studio (using IIS Express).
* Obake contains a docker file generated by Visual Studio. The docker file can be used to debug inside of a container locally via Visual Studio (see running locally) or it can be used via docker directly to build a docker image. 

1. Go to the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) home page, download, and install.
2. Clone this repo to your local machine 
3. In the root dirctory (same folder as the web.config), create a new text file called appsettings.json and use the following to populate it.
